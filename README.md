Slide 5 – Quantity Ordered Distribution ,Conclusion of the story & Recommendation

  ✅ Profitable States: Virginia and New York show strong profits. These regions should be prioritized for expansion and further investment.

  ❌ Unprofitable States: Pennsylvania and Ohio are recording losses despite receiving orders. This indicates possible issues such as high shipping costs, heavy discounts, or high          return rates. A detailed review of operations in these states is required.

  🎯 Customer Insights: A few customers contribute significantly to total profit, while many others generate very low or negative returns. Targeting high-value customers with loyalty        programs and tailored offers will improve profitability.

  📦 Order vs. Profit Gap: Some states with high order volumes do not necessarily generate high profits.


✅ Focus more on profitable states (Virginia, New York).

🔍 Investigate why some states are unprofitable (shipping cost, discounts, returns).

🎯 Target high-value customers for better sales strategy.
